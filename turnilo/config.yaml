    # possible options are:
    # * none - Do not do any introspection, take what is written in the config as the rule of law.
    # * no-autofill - Introspect the datasource but do not automatically generate dimensions or measures
    # * autofill-dimensions-only - Introspect the datasource, automatically generate dimensions only
    # * autofill-measures-only - Introspect the datasource, automatically generate measures only
